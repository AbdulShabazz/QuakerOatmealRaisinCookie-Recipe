Quaker Oats Oatmeal Raisins Cookie Recipe 

// Wet ingredients  
1/2 cup Butter (Melted)  
3/4 cup brown sugar  
1/2 cup granulated sugar  
2 whole eggs + 1 extra egg yolk  
1 tsp vanilla  
1 cup raisins  
1/2 cup molasses  

// Dry ingredients  
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour  
1 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1/2 tsp salt (taste)  
3 cups Quaker Oats  

1. Mix wet ingredients. Mix in bowl: butter, sugar, etc, until creamy. Note: Brown sugar has a higher moisture content than granulated sugar, which helps keep cookies soft and chewy. You can replace some or all of the granulated sugar in your recipe with brown sugar.
2. Mix dry ingredients. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined, then add wet ingredients.
3. Chill the dough: Chilling the dough for at least 30 minutes before baking helps solidify the fats in the dough, which results in a thicker, chewier cookie.
4. Preheat oven 325 F.
5. Drop tsp dough onto cookie sheet
6. Bake 8 to 10 min. (~40 cookies)
